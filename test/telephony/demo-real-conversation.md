# AI Summary Generation Testing Framework

## Overview

This document explains how we test the AI-powered conversation summarization system and the testing principles behind it.

## Test Scenario: Emergency Plumbing Service

### Sample Conversation Data
```
1. AI: "Welcome to DispatchAI Services! How can I help you today?"
2. Customer: "Hi, I have a major leak in my kitchen. The water is everywhere and I need urgent help!"
3. AI: "I understand this is urgent. Let me book an emergency plumber for you right away. Can you confirm your address?"
4. Customer: "Yes, I am at 123 Main Street, Melbourne. How soon can someone come?"
5. AI: "Perfect! I have booked an emergency plumber for you at 123 Main Street. They will arrive within 30 minutes. The service fee is $150. Is that acceptable?"
6. Customer: "Yes, that is perfect! Thank you so much. I really appreciate the quick response."
7. AI: "You are welcome! Your booking is confirmed. The plumber will contact you when they arrive. You will receive a confirmation SMS shortly."
```

### Expected AI Summary
**Summary**: "Customer contacted for emergency plumbing service due to major kitchen leak. Emergency plumber was successfully booked for 123 Main Street, Melbourne with 30-minute response time."

**Key Points**:
- Emergency kitchen leak requiring urgent attention
- Customer address: 123 Main Street, Melbourne
- Emergency plumber booked with 30-minute ETA
- Service fee $150 accepted by customer
- Booking confirmed with SMS notification scheduled

## Testing Principles & Methodology

### 1. Why Jest Testing Works for AI Systems

**Jest is suitable for AI testing because:**

- **Deterministic Mocking**: We mock the AI service responses to ensure predictable test results
- **Integration Testing**: Tests the complete data flow from conversation → AI analysis → database storage
- **Error Handling**: Validates system behavior when AI services fail
- **Data Validation**: Ensures correct data formatting and transformation

### 2. Are AI Results Deterministic?

**No, AI results are NOT deterministic in production**, but our tests handle this:

#### Production Reality:
```javascript
// Real AI call - results vary
const aiResponse = await llm.generateSummary(conversation);
// Could return different summaries each time due to:
// - Model temperature settings
// - Token sampling
// - Training variations
```

#### Test Strategy:
```javascript
// Test approach - mocked responses
mockHttpService.post.mockReturnValue(
  of({ data: mockAISummaryResponse }) // Controlled, predictable response
);
```

### 3. Testing Architecture

#### Layer 1: Unit Tests (Mocked AI)
```typescript
it('should send correct conversation data to AI service', async () => {
  // Mock AI response
  mockHttpService.post.mockReturnValue(of({ data: expectedSummary }));
  
  // Test data transformation
  await service.generateAISummary(callSid, session);
  
  // Verify correct API call structure
  expect(mockHttpService.post).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    'http://dispatchai-ai:8000/api/ai/summary',
    {
      callSid: 'test-call',
      conversation: [...], // Formatted conversation data
      serviceInfo: {...}   // Service context
    }
  );
});
```

#### Layer 2: Integration Tests (Full Flow)
```typescript
it('should complete full call processing with AI summary', async () => {
  // Setup all service mocks
  mockSessionRepository.load.mockResolvedValue(realConversation);
  mockHttpService.post.mockReturnValue(of({ data: aiSummary }));
  
  // Execute complete workflow
  await service.processCallCompletion(callSid, twilioParams);
  
  // Verify database operations
  expect(mockCalllogService.create).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(mockTranscriptService.update).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    transcriptId, 
    aiSummary
  );
});
```

#### Layer 3: Error Handling Tests
```typescript
it('should handle AI service failures gracefully', async () => {
  // Simulate AI service failure
  mockHttpService.post.mockImplementation(() => {
    throw new Error('AI service timeout');
  });
  
  // Should not break the main flow
  await expect(
    service.processCallCompletion(callSid, params)
  ).resolves.toBeUndefined();
  
  // Core data should still be saved
  expect(mockCalllogService.create).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### 4. What We Test vs. What We Don't

#### ✅ What We Test:
- **Data Flow**: Conversation → AI format → Database
- **API Integration**: Correct HTTP calls to AI service
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure when AI is unavailable
- **Database Operations**: Correct CallLog/Transcript/Chunk creation
- **Business Logic**: Status determination, data transformation

#### ❌ What We Don't Test:
- **AI Model Quality**: We don't test if summaries are "good"
- **LLM Performance**: Speed, accuracy, hallucinations
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Semantic correctness

### 5. Testing Database Operations

```typescript
// Database Storage Verification
expect(mockCalllogService.create).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
  callSid: 'test-call-ai-summary',
  userId: 'company-dispatch',
  serviceBookedId: 'service-plumbing',
  callerNumber: '+61412345678',
  callerName: 'Sarah Johnson',
  status: CallLogStatus.Completed,
  startAt: new Date('2024-03-21T10:02:00Z')
});
```

### 6. Why This Testing Approach Works

#### Reliability Through Mocking:
- **Predictable Results**: Same input always produces same test outcome
- **Fast Execution**: No external API calls in tests
- **Isolated Testing**: Tests don't depend on AI service availability

#### Comprehensive Coverage:
- **Happy Path**: AI works, data flows correctly
- **Error Path**: AI fails, system continues gracefully
- **Edge Cases**: Empty conversations, missing data

#### Production Confidence:
- **Contract Testing**: Ensures we send correct data to AI
- **Flow Validation**: Confirms complete workflow execution
- **Fallback Testing**: Validates system resilience

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run AI summary tests
pnpm test test/telephony/telephony-ai-summary.spec.ts

# Run all telephony tests
pnpm test test/telephony/

# Test results: 5/5 tests pass ✅
```

## Conclusion

While AI results are non-deterministic in production, our Jest-based testing framework provides reliable validation of:

1. **System Integration**: Data flows correctly through all components
2. **Error Resilience**: System handles AI failures gracefully
3. **Business Logic**: Conversation processing and status determination work correctly
4. **Database Operations**: All records are created with proper data

This approach gives us confidence that the system will work correctly regardless of AI output variations in production.
