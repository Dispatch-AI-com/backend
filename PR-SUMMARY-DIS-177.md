# DIS-177: CompanyController Security Fix - PR Summary

## 🔒 Security Vulnerability Fixed

**Issue:** All endpoints in `CompanyController` were publicly accessible without authentication  
**Severity:** HIGH RISK  
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive company data (ABN, phone numbers, addresses)

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT authentication required on all endpoints
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin vs user)
- ✅ Resource ownership verification
- ✅ Proper 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden responses

### Access Control Matrix
| Endpoint | Method | Unauthenticated | Regular User | Admin |
|----------|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| `/companies` | POST | ❌ 401 | ✅ (own company) | ✅ |
| `/companies` | GET | ❌ 401 | ❌ 403 | ✅ |
| `/companies/:id` | GET | ❌ 401 | ✅ (own only) | ✅ |
| `/companies/:id` | PATCH | ❌ 401 | ✅ (own only) | ✅ |
| `/companies/:id` | DELETE | ❌ 401 | ❌ 403 | ✅ |
| `/companies/email/:email` | GET | ❌ 401 | ✅ (own email) | ✅ |
| `/companies/user/:userId` | GET | ❌ 401 | ✅ (own userId) | ✅ |

## 🧪 Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests:** 8/8 passing
- **Integration Tests:** Authentication, authorization, and ownership scenarios
- **Coverage:** All endpoints tested for 401/403 responses

## 📁 Changes

### Files Added (7)
- `src/common/guards/roles.guard.ts` - Role-based access control
- `src/common/guards/company-owner.guard.ts` - Resource ownership verification
- `src/common/decorators/roles.decorator.ts` - @Roles() decorator
- `test/unit/company/company.controller.unit.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `test/integration/company/company.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests
- `test/fixtures/static/company.ts` - Test data
- `test/fixtures/dynamic/company.ts` - Test data generators

### Files Modified (2)
- `src/modules/company/company.controller.ts` - Added authentication guards
- `test/fixtures/index.ts` - Export company fixtures

## ✅ Requirements Verification

- ✅ All endpoints require valid authentication
- ✅ Public CRUD access blocked
- ✅ HTTP 401 for unauthenticated requests
- ✅ HTTP 403 for unauthorized requests
- ✅ Consistent guards/middleware implementation
- ✅ Security tests added
- ✅ No breaking changes for authorized users

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

- **Breaking Changes:** None for authorized users
- **Frontend Impact:** Must include JWT token in requests (already implemented)
- **Migration:** No migration needed - existing valid use cases preserved

## 🔍 Security Verification

To verify the fix:
```bash
# Should return 401
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/companies

# Should return 403 (for regular user)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/companies -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-token>"

# Should return 200 (for admin)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/companies -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>"
```
